Pull requests are welcome, but keep in mind that all of them will be reviewed and, whenever we find something out of our patterns, we will ask you to rewrite it before merging. We also recommend you test your code, but we will run our own tests too.

For major changes, however, please oen an issue and be available to discuss it.

Since the docstrings are in Portuguese, we have a preference for lusophones to contribute with it.
